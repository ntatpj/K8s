    kubectl get po
    kubectl delete po db-b54cd94f4-gp2d2  		(Observed a new DB POD was created, however the dynamic changes in the vote input was not reflected. I guess this was because there is DB isolation within the POD . DB input was from user and there was no redundancy for this information in the current database. Although a new POD was creted to store DB, howver the old DB cannot be retrived)
